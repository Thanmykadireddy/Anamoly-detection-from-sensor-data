# Anamoly-detection-from-sensor-data
This project detects anomalies in sensor data using various machine learning models. It involves data cleaning, feature selection, scaling, and training models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LightGBM, and a Neural Network. LightGBM performed best and was used for final predictions.
